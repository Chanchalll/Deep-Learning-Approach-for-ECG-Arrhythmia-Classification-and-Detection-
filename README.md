# Deep-Learning-Approach-for-ECG-Arrhythmia-Classification-and-Detection-
Used the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database to train and test various deep learning models, including CNN, AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet, and GoogLeNet. 
Applied resampling, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) techniques to address around 80:20 class imbalance, improving minority class data by 30%. 
Conducted a comparative analysis of models, achieving up to 99.86% accuracy and 98.90% F1-score with ResNet + SMOTE.
